## Abstract
This seminar project investigates the 2023 collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)
and Credit Suisse (CS) and their implications for financial stability and regulatory
policy, with a particular focus on Denmark. The study examines how the failu-
res unfolded and whether they triggered spillover effects in the European banking
sector. By combining qualitative case analysis with econometric modeling using an
EGARCH specification, the paper assesses the extent to which volatility in European
bank markets increased in response to the crises. The findings indicate a significant
volatility response following CS’s collapse, while SVB’s impact was less pronounced.
These results are discussed in the context of Denmark’s continued opt-out from the
EU Banking Union. Although the Banking Union offers a framework for coordinated
supervision and crisis resolution, questions remain regarding its relevance for Den-
mark. The analysis suggests that membership could enhance Denmark’s financial
resilience, but trade-offs related to national regulatory autonomy require further
consideration.
